- up to 1.2rc6
- fixed .init - rewritten, proper description
- fixed .inet - typo (not tested)
- updated URL, Source0 URL
- added -1.2rc6_maintainer.patch - by maintainer:
  "This patch fixing a configuration error: --prefix without --sysconfdir
  option."
- added -config.patch - works out of box with localhost and news.tpi.pl,
  private author's entries commented out
- proper group for subpackages: Applications/News
- %install, %files simplification
- %pre/%preun/%postun scripts for -standalone and inetd subpackages
- now works with newscache user and group (I consider that every daemon
  should be running from own user for security reasons) - appropriate
  trigger provided: sets newscache:newscache for /var/cache/newscache,
  updates Username and Groupname in /etc/NeswCache/newscache.conf
- cleaning
